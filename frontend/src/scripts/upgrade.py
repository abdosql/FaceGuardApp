# Updating your algorithm to be more like FET (Free Timetabling Software) involves adding more comprehensive constraint handling, user-friendly data input mechanisms, and possibly a graphical interface. Given the complexity and scope of FET, it's impractical to cover everything in a single response. However, I can guide you through enhancing your current algorithm with some features similar to FET's capabilities.
#
# Enhancements:
# More Comprehensive Constraints:
#
# Add constraints for teacher and student working hours, breaks, and preferred/forbidden times.
# Allow for specific room allocations and preferences.
# Implement group splits and subgroups.
# User-Friendly Data Input:
#
# Create functions to load input data from CSV or other common formats.
# Define a clear structure for input data to make it easier to use and maintain.
# Graphical Interface (Optional):
#
# If you want a GUI, consider using libraries like Tkinter for Python to build a basic interface for input and output.
# Below is an enhanced version of your algorithm incorporating some of these features:

# Explanation:
# Data Structure:
#
# The data dictionary now includes max_hours_per_day, lunch_break_start, lunch_break_end, and teacher_preferences for more comprehensive constraints.
# Constraints:
#
# Teacher Working Hours: Ensures teachers do not exceed a maximum number of teaching hours per day.
# Break Times: Prevents scheduling classes during specified break periods.
# Preferred Times: Teachers have specific availability times, and classes are scheduled accordingly.
# Enhanced User Input:
#
# The algorithm is designed to handle data input in a structured dictionary format, making it easier to extend with additional constraints and preferences.
# This updated algorithm adds more features and constraints to make it functionally closer to FET, although it still lacks a graphical interface and some advanced features of FET. Implementing a GUI and additional features would require more extensive development, possibly involving more advanced programming and use of specialized libraries.
